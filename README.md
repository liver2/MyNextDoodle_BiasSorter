# MyNextDoodle

Target Program: A "Sorter" that ranks user-inputted terms by user preference similar to a round-robin tournament

April 18: 
- Researched doodlepad Text class
- Implemented user input system to get terms from the user with Scanner class
- Created ArrayList-based system to collect terms
- Wrote the Term class which assigns a number or ranking to each term
- Wrote loop to declare each ArrayList String of terms as a Term, in an ArrayList of Terms
- Wrote a "brute-force sort" method akin to a round-robin tournament 
- Began writing the "Merger" class which uses merge-sort to sort the user-inputted terms
- Researched MergeSort
- Researched List class & implemented the subList() method

April 24:
- Researched efficient sorting algorithms (QuickSort?)
- Researched time complexity (discovered what O notation is)
- Resource used: https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/book.pdf
- Decided on Merge Sort (again, as it's most fundamental and has a low avg. runtime)
- Researched and attempted a quick derivation of Merge Sort in Java using recursion
- Finished first draft of derivation
- Debugging a Concurrent Modification Exception (current)
